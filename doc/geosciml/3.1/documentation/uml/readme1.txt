This directory contains an unversioned Enterprise Architect project file of the UML model for GeoSciML v3.1 (GeoSciMLv3.1.0.eap).  

It also contains the root XMI file (geosciml.xml) of a versioned EAP file.  However, it is strongly recommended that for versioned access to the GeoSciML UML model, you use the GeoSciML Subversion Repository, and follow the instructions at https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/CGIModel/ConfiguringEnterpriseArchitectForGeoSciML.
