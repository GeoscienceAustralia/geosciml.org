                        <br/>GeoSciML is an application schema that specifies a set of feature-types and supporting structures for information used in the solid-earth geosciences. <br/>
                        <br/>GeoSciML v2 is scoped approximately to the information required to construct geologic maps. "Map" is interpreted broadly, and not constrained to conventional 2-D semi-horizontal cartography, so the GeoSciML information structures also support representation of the distribution of geologic features on sections, along curvilinear-traverses and boreholes, within volumetric samples, etc. <br/>
                        <br/>GeoSciML v2 is primarily concerned with "interpreted" geology (units, structures, etc), but links to external schemas for the descriptions of observational data. <br/>
                        <br/>GeoSciML is factored into a set of sub-packages.</td>

                    <td width="80%">GeologicStructures are a configuration of matter in the Earth based on describable inhomogeneity, pattern, or fracture in an Earth Material.  The scale of geological structures ranges from microscopic (micron-scale) to megascopic (km-scale). Examples of such inhomogeneities include fractures, mineral grain boundaries, and boundaries between parts of the rock with different particle geometry (texture) or composition. Geologic structure is grounded in relationships between parts of a rock or rock body.   As used here, it includes sedimentary structures. The identity of a Geologic Structure is independent of the material that is the substrate for the structure. There are almost always strong dependencies between the nature of the Earth Material substrate and the kinds of Geological Structure that may be present. A disaggregated heap of particles does not have structure, and can  only be described in terms of the mineralogy and geometrical character of the constituent particles.  Geologic Structures are more likely to be found in, and are more persistent in, consolidated materials than in unconsolidated materials. Properties like "clast-supported", "matrix-supported", and "graded bed" that do not involve orientation are considered kinds of Geologic Structure because they depend on the configuration of parts of a rock body.</td>

These structures are designed to be able to capture value descriptions as conventionally recorded by geologists.  <br/>
                        <br/>The Value structures are for when you need <br/>1. a qualifier, <br/>2. to be able to use either single values or ranges, or <br/>3. to express uncertainty on numeric values <br/>4. use numbers or words as alternatives for a single value or in a mixed range<br/>
                        <br/>e.g. "usually X", "greater than Y" where X and Y are either a Measure (number with a scale) or Term (word from a vocabulary) or a range constructed from measures and terms<br/>
                        <br/>"CGI_GeometricDescriptions" allow describing the planar or linear orientation of a geologic feature. Allows specifying direction by DirectionVector (eg Dip/Dip Direction), compass point (NE), description ("toward fold hinge", "below')<br/>
                        <br/>These values are usually obtained as the result of an observation. The description of the associated observation event will provide more detail about the observation method, result quality, etc. </td>
