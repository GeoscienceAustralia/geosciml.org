            <p>The GeoSciML Earth Material package contains classes representing a description of a naturally occurring substance in the Earth.  <br/>
                <br/>Earth Material represents material composition or substance, and is thus independent of quantity or location. Ideally, Earth Materials are defined strictly based on physical properties, but because of standard geological usage, genetic interpretations may enter into the description as well. </p>

                        <br/>Relationships are always binary and directional.  There is always a single source and a single target.  The relationship is always defined from the perspective of the Source and is generally an active verb.<br/>
                        <br/>Example:  Consider an overgrowth of albite on plagioclase in a granite.  The  Source would point to the albite mineral description.  In this case, the Target would point to the plagioclase mineral description and the relationship attribute would be 'overgrowth' and the sourceRole is 'overgrows' and the targetRole is 'overgrown'.  Other appropriate role attributes might include: crosscuts, replaces, etc. for crosscutting and replacement relationships.</td>

                    <td>The Constituent Part class describes how Earth Materials may be made up of other Earth Materials, including the proportion of the constituent part in the whole (eg: 20%, minor, dominant); the role that the constituent plays in the whole (eg: matrix, groundmass, framework, phenocryst, xenolith, vein); and type of particle (eg: grain, clast, crystal, fossil, oolite)<br/>
                        <br/>The distinction between "role" and "particleType" is subtle.  An operational test is that constituentType may be determined independent of relationship between particles in the aggregation, whereas role requires consideration of the relationship to other particles. A particle may be identified as clast, independent of its material composition, and independent of its relationship to other grains in a rock. The term 'floating clast' is a role, because it is dependent on the relationship 'not in contact with other clasts'. Consider Dunham's textural classification of carbonate rocks (wackestone, packstone, grainstone...) in the description of carbonate rocks. The description is predicated on identification of two kinds of intraclasts (grains) and matrix (carbonate mud), and then uses this distinction to establish relationships--mud supported vs. grain supported -- that define roles for the two types of constituents (framework, matrix...).<br/>
                        <br/>examples of type vs. role:<br/>Particle type: clast. Role: framework, floating particle<br/>
                        <br/>particle type: crystal. Role: matrix, pseudomatrix (in case that matrix is interpreted as recrystallized material)<br/>
                        <br/>particle type: clast. Role: matrix (in case that matrix is interpreted as very-fine grained detrital fraction)<br/>
                        <br/>particle type: crystal. Role: cement (in case that material insterstitial to particles is crystalline material introduced during diagenesis)<br/>
                        <br/>particle type: crystal. Role: phenocryst (in igneous rock)<br/>
                        <br/>particle type: microlite Role: groundmass (in porphyrytic igneous rock)<br/>
                        <br/>particle type: crystal. Role: framework (in igneous rock)<br/>
                        <br/>particle type: pyroclast. role: framework (in tuff)<br/>
                        <br/>particle type: crystal Role: oikocryst<br/>
                        <br/>particle type: crystal Role: overgrowth<br/>
                        <br/>particle type: biogenic particle Role: floating particle<br/>

It denotes a pattern, defined by one or more CompoundMaterial constituents, that is present throughout a rock body when considered at some scale.  FabricDescription is defined based on the average configuration of many constituents.  Penetrative fabric denotes that these constituents are distributed throughout the rock volume at the scale of observation [Passchier and Trouw, 1998], and are repeated at distances that are small relative to the scale of the whole, such that they can be considered to pervade the whole uniformly (Turner and Weiss [1963] p. 21-24; Hobbs and others [1976], p. 73; Jackson [1997]; Passchier and Trouw [1998]). <br/>
                        <br/>FabricDescription is distinguished from Particle Geometry based on the criteria that Particle Geometry is preserved if a CompoundMaterial is disaggregated, while FabricDescription is not defined if the material is disaggregated.<br/>
