A set of RDFgraphs representing the International [Chrono]stratigraphic Chart, comprising Turtle serializations of data from the 2016 version, along with updated ontologies that define the structure of the data. 

In this version the Geological Timescale Model is aligned with the W3C OWL-Time ontology https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/ for the temporal topology, with OGC GeoSPARQL http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geosparql for location data, and with the W3C SOSA/SSN ontology for samples.


Updated to match the 2016 International Chronostratigraphic Chart. 

Ontology aligned woth OWL-Time, GeoSPARQL and SOSA.  

Original data scraped from the website of the International Commission for Stratigraphy, http://www.stratigraphy.org Transcribed into RDF by Cox & Richard. Multilingual labels entered by SMR and Marshall Ma (RPI - now University of Idaho)
