http://resource.geosciml.org/classifierscheme/cgi/201202/mappedfeatureobservationmethod,CGI Mapped Feature Observation Method Term Vocabulary,"This file contains the CGI Mapped feature observation method vocabulary. These are terms that specify how a MappedFeature instance was mapped. MappedFeature ObservationMethod is essentially a metadata snippet indicating how the spatial extent of the mapped feature was determined, and the basis for association of the geometry with some GeologicFeature specification to define a MappedFeature. Observation method is a convenience property that provides a quick and dirty approach to shortcut use of more comprehensive observation and measurement construct when data are reported using a feature view (as opposed to observation view).@en ., skos:changeNote 2009-12-07 SMR Update metadata properties for version, creator, title, and format.
