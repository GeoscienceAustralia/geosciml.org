http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/bed_lithosome,Bed lithosome,Lithosome in lithostratigraphic unit that occurs as individual beds interleaved with other constituents on the outcrop (m) scale or larger.,This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/blocks,Blocks,Geologic unit constituent is present as masses with generally sharp boundaries and block-like geometry within a matrix of some other material emplaced by processes at the earth's surface--e.g. volcanic eruption or mass wasting. Implication is that blocks were derived from the same source geologic unit and emplaced in the described unit.,This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/concretion,Concretion,"Hard, compact mass or aggregate of mineral matter, normally subsperical but commonly oblate, disc-shaped or irregular. Formed from precipitation from solution about a nucleus or centre. Use as a geologic unit part should be restricted to concretions that are too large to consider as constituents in the rock material that composes the unit.",Neuendorf et al. 2005

http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/lithosome,Lithosome,"A kind of rock body that has multiple occurrences in a single geologic unit. A mass of rock of uniform character, characterized by geometry, composition, and internal structure. Generally denotes rock mass that is the product of a particular rock forming process or related sequence of processes in the containing unit. Example--bouma sequence, point bar sequence. A particular lithosome may be characterized by the presence of blocks, but blocks are not treated as kinds of lithosome because the internal character of the blocks is determined by a separate genetic sequence from the described unit. This vocabulary generalizes the concept defined in Neuendorf et al 2005 to include bodies of igneous or metamorphic rock as well as sedimentary rock. NADM SLTTs (2004) used the term 'lithotope' with similar meaning for sedimentary rocks.",This vocabulary

http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/pendants,Pendants,"A block of wall rock material in an igneous intrusion. Pendants become xenoliths as the dimension becomes smaller than about 10 m in their longest dimension. Although term pendant has connotation of being suspended or supported from above, this is rarely demonstrable in geologic situations, and the concept here does not require connection to the wall of the containing intrusion.",Base on Neuendorf et al 2005

http://resource.geosciml.org/classifierscheme/cgi/201202/geologicunitpartrole,CGI Geologic Unit Part Role vocabulary,"This file contains the CGI Geologic Unit Part role vocabulary. This vocabulary includes terms to specify the role of a geologic unit as part of another geologic unit, the role of a CompositionPart in a geologic unit. These terms may be used to populate GeologicUnit.part.GeologicUnitPart.role, and GeologicUnit.composition.CompositionPart.role. There are terms in This vocabulary that only apply to one or the other of these properties, but after an effort to create two separate vocabularies, it was decided to use a single vocabulary in order to avoid having the same concept in more than one closely related vocabulary. The duplication of applicable concepts in the two contexts (GeologicUnit.part.GeologicUnitPart.role and GeologicUnit.composition.CompositionPart.role) arises because the model allows representation of complex geologic unit descriptions in more than one way. A complex geologic unit like a migmatite complex or a lithologically heterogeneous Pennsylvanian cyclothem stratigraphic unit will have many different lithologic components. The simplest approach to representing the lithologic heterogeneity is to report a single GeologicUnit element with compositionParts for each lithologic component, the role on these compositionParts provides information about what kind of parts they are and perhaps something about their relationship, along with the kinds of rock they are composed of. A more complex alternate approach is to represent the various components each as GeologicUnit elements, each with compositionPart links to the rock type(s) composing that part. These component GeologicUnit elements are aggregated by GeologicUnit.part.GeologicUnitPart elements, with roles in the aggregation for each GeologicUnit part. The benefit of the more complex approach is that additional descriptive properties provided by the GeologicUnit content model can be assigned to each part, as well as GeologicRelations between the parts. The role of the compositionParts in these more 'disaggregated' GeologicUnit elements would be a simpler 'composition' kind of role, because the heterogeneous 'whole' unit would be described in GeologicUnitParts that are more lithologically homogeneous. Its a standard trade off between simplicity and expressiveness. As far as the vocabulary for these 'role' properties, the decision to merge the compositionPart.role and GeologicUnitPart.role vocabularies into one was based on the idea that from a user point of view, one would not want to have to use terms from two different vocabularies to search for the same concept. For instance, if one wanted 'all geologicUnits that have parts whose role is 'Tectonic block', a merged vocabulary allows construction of a single xpath where \role = 'CGI....:Tectonic_block'\ (or something like that). The single vocabulary also simplifies maintenance. A context column is added in the spreadsheet to distinguish terms for 'compositionPart', 'geologicUnitPart' or 'both'.@en .","2009-12-07 SMR Update metadata properties for version, creator, title, and format.
