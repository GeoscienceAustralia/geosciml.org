http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lineationtype/bedding_cleavage_intersection_lineation,Bedding cleavage intersection lineation,Lineation defined by the intersection of bedding surfaces and cleavage surfaces.,this vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lineationtype/biotite_mineral_lineation,Biotite mineral lineation,"Mineral lineation defined by aligned elongate biotite aggregates in a foliation surface. Biotite does not have an elongate (prismatic, acicular) mineral habit, so production of lineation must reflect elongate aggregates of biotite crystals.",this vocabulary

http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lineationtype/crenulation_lineation,Crenulation lineation,"Lineation defined by small-scale wrinkles, typically of phylosillicate minerals, on another surface, typically a cleavage or schistosity. Use instead of intersection lineation if the wrinkles are the measured feature and the intersecting planar feature is not apparent.",this vocabulary

http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lineationtype/igneous_lineation,Igneous lineation,Lineation defined by alignment of elongate fabric elements formed in lava or magma before complete crystallization. Some typical fabric elements are elongate phenocrysts and vesicles.,this vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lineationtype/igneous_mineral_lineation,Igneous mineral lineation,Lineation in igneous rock defined by aligned crystals where there is evidence that the crystal alignment is related to process occurring before the rock was solidified.,this vocabulary
"http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lineationtype/igneous_particle_shape_lineation,  Igneous particle shape lineation,  Lineation in an igneous rock, usually welded tuff, defined by elongate objects in the rock (usually pumice pads, also elongate crystals). Descriptive--elogation may be due to deformation or to rotation/alignment of originally elongate (prolate ellipsoid) objects in the rock.,  this vocabulary",,,

http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lineationtype/particle_shape_lineation,Particle shape lineation,"Lineation defined by alignment of long axes of prolate-shaped particles such as clasts, fossils, crystals, or phenocrysts. Particles may be polycrystalline aggregates formed by deformation of pre-existing particles. General category does not specify genesis of particles or their alignment.",this vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lineationtype/pencil_lineation,Pencil lineation,"Lineation defined by tendency of rock to break into long, slender pieces resembling pencils. Typically produced by intesection of bedding and cleavage or intersection of two cleavages. Fabric is generally only observed in weakly metamorphosed rocks.",based on Neuendorf et al 2005

http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lineationtype/stretching_lineation,Stretching lineation,"Lineation defined by elongate (prolate) fabric elements in which the alignment of the fabric elements, and the formation of prolate fabric elements is interpreted to be the product of crystal plastic deformation processes. Associated with mylontic foliation.",this vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lineationtype/tectonic_lineation,Tectonic lineation,"Penetrative linear structure in a rock body defined by fabric elements that are the product of tectonic processes. Linear is used in the sense that the orientation of the structure can be represented as a line in some sufficiently small neighborhood of any point in the material containig the fabric. Penetrative denotes that the fabric elements defining the structure are repeated at distances so small, compared with the scale of the whole…that they can be considered to pervade it uniformly and be present at every point (paraphrase of Turner and Weiss, 1963, p. 21).",this vocabulary
