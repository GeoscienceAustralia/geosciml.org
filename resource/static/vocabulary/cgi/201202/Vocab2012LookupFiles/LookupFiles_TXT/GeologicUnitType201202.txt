http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunittype/allostratigraphic_unit,Allostratigraphic Unit,"Geologic unit defined by bounding surfaces. Not necessarily stratified. Donovon (2004, IUGS abstract Florence) makes good case for use of a noncommittal term for the bounding surface. While there may be no agreement that a given stratal boundary is a discontinuity, there is consensus that all the identified boundaries are stratal surfaces. Includes: 1. Unconformity bounded units (Salvador 1994), defined by bounding stratigraphic discontinuities ('significant unconformities', unconformity is defined as surface of erosion in Salvador 1994). 2. Sequence stratigraphic unit, an allostratigraphic unit that is used to interpret the depositional origin of sedimentary strata and assumes, though this is not always stated, an implicit connection to base level change. It does this by establishing how the sequence of strata accumulated in order in the sedimentary section over a subdividing framework of surfaces.","This vocabulary, Salvador, 1994, Donovon 2004 IUGS abstract."
