The 'material' composition of these parts will often be other rock materials,not minerals,and 'ParticleGeometryDescription' associated with these describes the geometry of the constituent,not the particles the it is made of. These roles are mostly useful for RockMaterial descriptions that apply to individual samples,because their distribution is unlikely to be pervasive enought to be considered characteristic of a large mass of material."
