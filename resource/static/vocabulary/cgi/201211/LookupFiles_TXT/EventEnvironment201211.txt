http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/eventenvironment/algal_flat_setting	algal flat setting	"Modern algal flats are found on rock or mud in areas flooded only by the highest tides and are often subject to high evaporation rates. Algal flats survive only when an area is salty enough to eliminate snails and other herbivorous animals that eat algae, yet is not so salty that the algae cannot survive. The most common species of algae found on algal flats are blue-green algae of the genera Scytonema and Schizothrix. These algae can tolerate the daily extremes in temperature and oxygen that typify conditions on the flats. Other plants sometimes found on algal flats include one-celled green algae, flagellates, diatoms, bacteria, and isolated scrubby red and black mangroves, as well as patches of saltwort. Animals include false cerith, cerion snails, fiddler crabs, and great land crabs. Flats with well developed algal mats are restricted for the most part to the Keys, with Sugarloaf and Crane Keys offering prime examples of algal flat habitat.
