http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/bed_lithosome	bed lithosome	Lithosome in lithostratigraphic unit that occurs as individual beds interleaved with other constituents on the outcrop (m) scale or larger.	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/blocks	blocks	Geologic unit constituent is present as masses with generally sharp boundaries and block-like geometry within a matrix of some other material emplaced by processes at the earth's surface--e.g. volcanic eruption or mass wasting. Implication is that blocks were derived from the same source geologic unit and emplaced in the described unit.	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/concretion	concretion	"Hard, compact mass or aggregate of mineral matter, normally subsperical but commonly oblate, disc-shaped or irregular. Formed from precipitation from solution about a nucleus or centre. Use as a geologic unit part should be restricted to concretions that are too large to consider as constituents in the rock material that composes the unit."	Neuendorf et al. 2005
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/cyclic_bedding_package	cyclic bedding package	"Lithosome characterized by an internal sequence of units, which is repeated in a stacked sequence, e.g. fining-upward sequence, thickening upward sequence, bouma sequence."	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/enclave	enclave	General term for a polymineralic aggregate enclosed in a granitoid.	"Cobbing, 2000, Barbarin, 1991"
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/facies	facies	"Represents a particular body of rock that is a lateral variant of a lithostratigraphic unit, or a variant of a lithodemic unit. Contrast with lithosome in being a particular, connected body of rock, as opposed to a kind of rock body that is repeated in many places in a unit."	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/geologic_unit_matrix	geologic unit matrix	"Lithosome in a geologic unit that is generally interstitial to other constituents, e.g. in a mass wasting deposit, melange, tuff breccia."	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/inclusion	inclusion	Geologic unit constituent is present as masses with generally sharp boundaries enclosed within a matrix of some other material.	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/irregular_lithosome	irregular lithosome	lithosome in a mixed/heterogeneous lithodemic unit that occurs in irregular bodies within unit	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/layer_lithosome	layer lithosome	lithosome in igneous or metamorphic geologic unit that occurs as layers alternating with other constituents.	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/lenticular_lithosome	lenticular lithosome	"lithosome occurs as discrete lense-shaped bodies, not connected with other bodies."	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/lithosome	lithosome	"A kind of rock body that has multiple occurrences in a single geologic unit. A mass of rock of uniform character, characterized by geometry, composition, and internal structure. Generally denotes rock mass that is the product of a particular rock forming process or related sequence of processes in the containing unit. Example--bouma sequence, point bar sequence. A particular lithosome may be characterized by the presence of blocks, but blocks are not treated as kinds of lithosome because the internal character of the blocks is determined by a separate genetic sequence from the described unit. This vocabulary generalizes the concept defined in Neuendorf et al 2005 to include bodies of igneous or metamorphic rock as well as sedimentary rock. NADM SLTTs (2004) used the term 'lithotope' with similar meaning for sedimentary rocks."	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/marker_bed	marker bed	Stratigraphic part that is a thin laterally continuous bed within another unit.	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/only_part	only part	entire described unit consists of a single part or constituent	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/part_of	part of	The geologic unit part role is not known in any greater detail. Inclusion of Only_part as a separate concept implies that this concept is the equivalent of 'proper part' in mereology.	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/pendants	pendants	"A block of wall rock material in an igneous intrusion. Pendants become xenoliths as the dimension becomes smaller than about 10 m in their longest dimension. Although term pendant has connotation of being suspended or supported from above, this is rarely demonstrable in geologic situations, and the concept here does not require connection to the wall of the containing intrusion."	Base on Neuendorf et al 2005
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/rafts	rafts	Pendants of pre-intrusive country rock in intrusive igneous matrix that have large horizontal extent relative to their thickness	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/roof_pendant	roof pendant	Pendant that is demonstrably derived from the upper boundary of an igneous body.	Neuendorf et al 2005
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/screen	screen	Pendant that is a vertical sheet like pendant in an intrusive igneous rock body.	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/stratigraphic_part	stratigraphic part	A geologic unit part that occupies a particular stratigraphic position within a geologic unit. Part is a particular body of rock.	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/tectonic_block	tectonic block	"The geologic unit part occurs as discrete masses with faulted boundaries, emplaced into the host unit by tectonic processes inside the earth, e.g. blocks in tectonic melange"	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/unspecified_part_role	unspecified part role	"Geologic unit part with unspecified role, use in normative descriptions when any role is allowed."	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/vein_or_dike_lithosome	vein or dike lithosome	"Lithosome occurs as intrusive, sheet-like bodies within the unit as an essential part of the unit."	This vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/geologicunitpartrole/xenolith	xenolith	"Inclusion of pre-intrusive country rock in intrusive igneous matrix, cm to about 10 meter diameter in longest dimension. Use term pendant for larger blocks."	"Neuendorf et al. 2005, Cobbing, 2000, This vocabulary"
