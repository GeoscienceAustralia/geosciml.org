http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/determinationmethodorientation/calculated_average_orientation	calculated average orientation	Orientation value is specified using a calculated average of a collection of related orientations (computer generalization).	this vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/determinationmethodorientation/estimate_from_air_photo	estimate from air photo	Orientation of a geologic structure estimated based on inspection or measurements on an air photograph.	this vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/determinationmethodorientation/estimate_from_distance	estimate from distance	Orientation of a geologic structure based on observation from a distance great enough to preclude direct inspection of the structure to determine orientation.	this vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/determinationmethodorientation/measure_on_outcrop	measure on outcrop	"Orientation of surface or line is measured on an outcrop of that surface or line directly, e.g. by measuring a particular bedding surface, a 3-D exposure of a fold hinge, a particular stretched mineral grain in a foliation surface."	this vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/determinationmethodorientation/method_unknown	method unknown	use value qualifier to specify the kind of nil	this vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/determinationmethodorientation/photogeologic_determination	photogeologic determination	Orientation determined based on measurements from aerial photography or satellite imagery (in conjunction with an elevation model.	this vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/determinationmethodorientation/standard_on_site_measure	standard on site measure	Orientation measured using compass or other instrument directly on or at an outcrop of the structure.	this vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/determinationmethodorientation/three_point_determination	three point determination	Orientation determined by fitting a plane to three or more points located on the geologic surface of interest.	this vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/determinationmethodorientation/visual_surface_estimation_on_outcrop	visual surface estimation on outcrop	"Orientation of a surface is measured by visually averaging across one or more outcrops in a small area--e.g. approximating dip by looking down strike of beds, approximating strike by outcrop trace of one or more beds."	this vocabulary
