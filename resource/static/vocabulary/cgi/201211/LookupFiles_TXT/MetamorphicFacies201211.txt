http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/metamorphicfacies/metamorphic_facies_not_specified	metamorphic facies not specified	"Metamorphosed, but facies not specified in more detail. For use in normative description to indicate that any metamorphic facies value is valid."	this vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/metamorphicfacies/metamorphic_facies_unknown	metamorphic facies unknown	For use in instance descriptions to indicate that no data are available to constrain metamorphic facies.  May be metamorphosed or non-metamorphosed.	this vocabulary
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/metamorphicfacies/no_metamorphic_minerals	no metamorphic minerals	"Corresponds to non-metamorphosed condition, since metamorphic facies classification is based on mineral assemblages, absence of metamorphic minerals means that the classification does not apply."	this vocabulary
