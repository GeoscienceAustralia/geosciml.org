# International Chronostratigraphic Chart

Multiple versions of the ISC, as published at http://stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-chart-timescale 

ISC timescale vocabularies for ISC2004 through ISC2016-10 are formalized according to the geologic timescale ontology http://resource.geosciml.org/ontology/timescale/gts-30, using the THORS/GTS model aligned to ISO 19108 temporal schema and ISO 19156 Obsservations schema, as described in https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12145-014-0170-6 

ISC Timescale vocabularies after ISC2016-12 are formalized according to geologic timescale ontology http://resource.geosciml.org/ontology/timescale/gts/w3c, which is updated to align with OWL-Time (http://www.w3.org/2006/time) instead of ISO 19108, and imports SOSA (http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/), a lightweight alignment with ISO19156.   Spatial data uses GeoSPARQL (instead of OWL implementation of ISO 19107)
