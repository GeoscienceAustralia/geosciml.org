A set of RDFgraphs representing the International [Chrono]stratigraphic Chart, comprising Turtle serializations of data from the 2017-02 version, along with updated ontologies that define the structure of the data.

The Geological Timescale Model is aligned with the W3C OWL-Time ontology https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/ for the temporal topology, with OGC GeoSPARQL http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geosparql for location data, and with the W3C SOSA/SSN ontology for samples.

The content of the vocabulary matches the 2017-02 International Chronostratigraphic Chart.

Original data scraped from the website of the International Commission for Stratigraphy, http://www.stratigraphy.org Transcribed into RDF by Cox & Richard. Multilingual labels entered by SMR and Marshall Ma (RPI - now University of Idaho)
